# PhD_Script_chemistry
During my PhD, I coded (probably not perfectly) different scripts for different purposes, such as the conversion of files, or analyze of MD. I try to put the more useful ones here.

# GaussianOutput_to_lammps.py

It allows to read from a gaussian output file, the final structure and to trasnform it into a data file for Lammps. It takes into account C H O atoms.

(It does not create the force field, but it can be easily used with ReaxFF)
